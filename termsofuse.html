<p class="extended-discography">Content: All content on this website is original and protected by copyright.
This includes, but is not limited to, all images, photographs, artist name, artist logo, label name, label logo, radio show title, music cover arts, mix episode cover arts, merchandise shop name, design elements, and written text - all of which are the exclusive creations and intellectual property of Jayface.<br>
This website was entirely designed and developed by Jayface, based on a custom concept and layout.
Every aspect of this site is original and solely owned by Jayface. Any use, reproduction, or distribution of the content without the prior and exclusive permission of Jayface is strictly prohibited.<br>
Brand Ownership and Trademark: The name, logo, and brand identity associated with this website constitute distinctive elements uniquely developed and continuously used by the creator, Jayface (legal name: Akos Juhasz). It has been 20 years since the name Jayface was first created in 2005 by Akos Juhasz, and since then, all original music has been written and officially registered under this name. The Jayface logo was created in 2021, marking a new visual chapter of the brand. It was officially launched in partnership with the creator’s record label, Jayface Music. These elements are protected under applicable intellectual property laws, including copyright, common law trademark rights, and prior use doctrines.
The name and logo represent a unified creative identity - artist, label, mix show, and fashion brand in one. The ™ symbol is used to assert the creator’s ongoing rights and claims over the brand identity in connection with goods, services, and public representation. Any unauthorized reproduction, misrepresentation, commercial exploitation, or imitation of the brand - in part or in whole - is strictly prohibited and may result in legal action.
